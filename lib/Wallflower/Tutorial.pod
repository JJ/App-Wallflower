Wallflower::Tutorial - Turn your Plack app into a static site

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # do cool stuff using Plack-aware frameworks,
    # to generate static web sites

=head1 WRITING A PSGI APPLICATION FOR WALLFLOWER

=head2 All URL should have an extension

A PSGI/Plack is able to define the C<Content-Type> that will be sent
for any URL content.

On the other hand, static file servers use the extension to decide what
C<Content-Type> to send for a given file. When unable to decide what
the file content is, servers usually send C<application/octet-stream>
as the C<Content-Type>.

Since the goal of a L<Wallflower> application is to generate a static
website, it is recommended that I<all URL should have an extensions>.
